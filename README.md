# org.corfield/rephrase

Rephrase exceptions.

Error messages in Clojure have been a long-standing source of frustration
for beginners. This library is an experiment in rephrasing exceptions to
make them more beginner-friendly.

The library provides two main functions:
* `org.corfield.rephrase/repl-caught` - a replacement for `clojure.main/repl-caught` that rephrases exceptions before printing them (via the `:caught` option when starting a REPL),
* `org.corfield.rephrase.nrepl/wrap-rephrase` - nREPL middleware that applies `repl-caught` to produce rephrased exceptions in nREPL sessions.

There is also a helper function that applications or tools might use:
* `org.corfield.rephrase/rephrase-err->msg` - a replacement for `clojure.main/err->msg` that takes an exception and returns a rephrased error message string.

Error messages are rephrased to a single line, with the cause first, followed
by the location of the error. This makes inline display of error messages in
editors easier to read, especially if the editor normally suppresses the
second line of the standard exception report (e.g., Calva), or truncates long 
messages.

## Usage

Add the following dependency to your project (or as a global dependency
in your user-level `deps.edn` or `profiles.clj` file):

```clojure
org.corfield/rephrase {:mvn/version "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"}
```

This snapshot version will be updated frequently as I get feedback from the
community. Once it reaches a sufficiently stable state, I will release a 1.0.0 
version.

### nREPL Middleware

This is probably the most common way to use this library.

For use with nREPL, add `org.corfield.rephrase.nrepl/wrap-rephrase` to your
list of middleware. See
[nREPL Middleware Setup](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/basics/middleware_setup.html)
in the CIDER documentation for details on how to do this.

### Starting a REPL with `:caught`

You can also use `org.corfield.rephrase/repl-caught` directly when starting a REPL, by passing it as the value of the `:caught` option. For example:

```clojure
(require '[org.corfield.rephrase :as rephrase])

(clojure.main/repl :caught rephrase/repl-caught)
```

### Customization

You can add more mappings by adding `org/corfield/rephrase-user.edn` to your 
classpath with the same structure as `config.edn`.
See [the source](https://github.com/seancorfield/rephrase/blob/main/resources/org/corfield/rephrase/config.edn)
for details.
_More detailed documentation on customization will be provided in the future._

## Inspiration

There have been a lot of discussions and libraries started around this topic.
I've toyed with the idea of rephrasing exceptions for several years, and have
started to write a library like this more than once.

[Adrian Smith](https://github.com/phronmophobic/) provided a long list of
links on [Slack](https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C03S1KBA2/p1756162447266729)
that has been great background reading for this project.

Much of the initial mapping of class names and rephrasing of exception messages
comes from [Babel](https://github.com/Clojure-Intro-Course/babel).
